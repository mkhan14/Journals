Day 1: 5/4/17
	Goal: Today, I will begin some research on chatrooms and also begin reviewing JavaScript.
	I read some pages about chatrooms and looked at some of my old projects to jog my memory
	about JavaScript.
Day 2: 5/5/17
	Goal: Today, I will begin reviewing HTML and CSS.
	I did begin reviewing HTML and CSS by looking at my old projects, but then there was a 
	change of plans. Instead of writing in JavaScript, we decided we would write in Java and 
	not just make a text-based chatroom, but a chat with voice functionality. I viewed some 
	videos about making a chatroom and also looked at some pages on how to use Vaadin. My goal
	for Monday is to continue research and proceed to working on the front end.
Day 3: 5/8/17
	Goal: Today, I will research how to make audio calls with Java.
