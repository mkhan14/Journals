Day 1: 5/4/17
	Goal: Today, I will begin some research on chatrooms and also begin reviewing JavaScript.
	I read some pages about chatrooms and looked at some of my old projects to jog my memory
	about JavaScript.
Day 2: 5/5/17
	Goal: Today, I will begin reviewing HTML and CSS.
	I did begin reviewing HTML and CSS by looking at my old projects, but then there was a 
	change of plans. Instead of writing in JavaScript, we decided we would write in Java and 
	not just make a text-based chatroom, but a chat with voice functionality. I viewed some 
	videos about making a chatroom and also looked at some pages on how to use Vaadin. My goal
	for Monday is to continue research and proceed to working on the front end.
Day 3: 5/8/17
	Goal: Today, I will research how to make audio calls with Java.
	I began researching how to make audio calls in Java by looking at some videos and web pages.
	There wasn't much I saw on how to make video chat with Java, but I saw how the products looked
	like, and that could be inspiration or a guide for how our product could look. I also looked at 
	information about Google App Engine and Vaadin.
	My goal for tomorrow is to look at how to use Vaadin and Google App Engine. 
Day 4: 5/9/17
	Goal: Today, I will try to think of an aspect to add to the chat program.
	I looked up how to upload images with Java to a server and how to change font size by watching
	several videos and reading web pages. I also looked at more examples of chat programs and found 
	more ways to design the chat program. 
	My goal for tomorrow is to focus on a specific part of the project to work on.
Day 5: 5/10/17
	Goal: Today, I will continue researching how to upload images.
