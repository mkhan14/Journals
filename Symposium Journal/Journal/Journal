Day 1: 5/4/17
	Goal: Today, I will begin some research on chatrooms and also begin reviewing JavaScript.
	I read some pages about chatrooms and looked at some of my old projects to jog my memory
	about JavaScript.
Day 2: 5/5/17
	Goal: Today, I will begin reviewing HTML and CSS.
	I did begin reviewing HTML and CSS by looking at my old projects, but then there was a 
	change of plans. Instead of writing in JavaScript, we decided we would write in Java and 
	not just make a text-based chatroom, but a chat with voice functionality. I viewed some 
	videos about making a chatroom and also looked at some pages on how to use Vaadin. My goal
	for Monday is to continue research and proceed to working on the front end.
Day 3: 5/8/17
	Goal: Today, I will research how to make audio calls with Java.
	I began researching how to make audio calls in Java by looking at some videos and web pages.
	There wasn't much I saw on how to make video chat with Java, but I saw how the products looked
	like, and that could be inspiration or a guide for how our product could look. I also looked at 
	information about Google App Engine and Vaadin.
	My goal for tomorrow is to look at how to use Vaadin and Google App Engine. 
Day 4: 5/9/17
	Goal: Today, I will try to think of an aspect to add to the chat program.
	I looked up how to upload images with Java to a server and how to change font size by watching
	several videos and reading web pages. I also looked at more examples of chat programs and found 
	more ways to design the chat program. 
	My goal for tomorrow is to focus on a specific part of the project to work on.
Day 5: 5/10/17
	Goal: Today, I will continue researching how to upload images.
	I continued to research how to upload images. I learned that a file-chooser can be used to do this.
	I looked up the errors that could arise from uploading images into a chat program, such as IOException
	and ClassNotFoundException. I also began looking up absolute path, which could be relevant to displaying
	images from the image receiver side.
	My goal for tomorrow is to continue researching and discussing the implications of image uploading.
Day 6: 5/11/17
	Goal: Today, I will look at the front end portion of the client and server side code and see how to modify it.
	I looked at ways to store images into databases. The usual way to do that is to store the directory of the image.
	I viewed some of the tutorial videos on how to make a chat program to refresh my memory and to clear up any confusion.
	I cleared up confusion about why a do-while loop and try-catch statements are needed. I looked at the server-side code
	and saw if there was anything that didn't make sense to me.
	My goal for tomorrow is to watch the client-side tutorials.
Day 7: 5/12/17
	Goal: Today, I will watch the client-side tutorials.
	I watched some tutorials on the client-side. I looked up how to read and write files in Java, since that will be
	needed if one wants to send messages over the chat program. I was more clear about objectInputStream and
	objectOutputStream. Sending images is common in a messaging program, such as emojis or uploaded images, so I will
	see how to make it happen.
	My goal for Monday is to find how to send images over the chat program.
Day 8: 5/15/17
	Goal: Today, I will look up the JFileChooser.
	I watched some videos on JFileChooser and tried to understand the code that was in the videos. I looked up how to read
	and write images in Java. I saw many useful stackoverflow pages about sending images through sockets and sending
	images from the client to server. This included some examples and advice. Watching videos on setting up the client and
	server portions of the chat program helped my understanding.
	My goal for tomorrow is to start coding using the JFileChooser first.
Day 9: 5/16/17
	Goal: Today, I will use the JFileChooser to start coding.
	I started coding the image uploader by using the JFileChooser video. I found a video on sending images with sockets, 
	so I will try to use that in the future. I made a new package and imageSender class and began to code the constructor.
	I think I am nearly done with it.
	My goal for tomorrow is to continue coding the image uploader and to test it out.
Day 10: 5/17/17
	Goal: Today, I will continue coding the image uploader.
	I continued to code the image uploader using JFileChooser. I tested it out by making another class with a main method.
	The image is able to be selected from the computer. This is proven by making the image appear in a window. I researched
	how to send images over sockets and how to append images to the chat window. I found some resources by watching some videos
	and reading some stackoverflow pages, but I have to look into it further.
	My goal for tomorrow is to continue researching how to send images over sockets and append images to the chat window.
Day 11: 5/18/17
	Goal: Today, I will continue researching how to send images over sockets and append images to the chat window.
	I continued to research how to send images over sockets and append images to the chat window. I spent more time with
	looking at how to append images to the chat window. Doing this on a JTextArea would be tough, so I was advised to do it with
	JTextPane. I made a new JTextPane and positioned it to the left of the chatbox. Images could be shown on the left section
	while text can be shown on the right.
	My goal for the next day we work is to test out displaying images to the program.
Day 12: 5/22/17
	Goal: Today I will test out displaying images to the program and see how to send them over sockets.
	I tried to find out how to display images on the chat program. I could do this using the insertIcon method. I looked
	at more videos on how to send images and files over sockets and how to send files from client to server.
	My goal for tomorrow is to show an image on the chat window and to implement the file chooser with the sending of images
	over sockets.
Day 13: 5/23/17
	Goal: Today, I will try to implement the file chooser with the sending of images over sockets.
	I added another picture to the JTextPane. It looks abnormal, as it sits next to the first image and when the window is
	maximized, it consumes the whole window. I then tried to send images from the computer over sockets using the JFileChooser.
	I have to somehow convert RenderedImages to BufferedImages.
	My goal for tomorrow is to continue trying to send an image over sockets with the JFileChooser and then display it in another 
	window as a test.
Day 14: 5/24/17
	Goal: Today, I will try to send an image over sockets with the JFileChooser and display it in another window.
	I made the image be read before it is written, and it made the compilation errors go away. But, the JFileChooser still
	does not show on the screen after the client and server are connected.
	My goal for tomorrow is to continue trying to make the JFileChooser display and make an image selectable so it shows in
	another window.
Day 15: 5/25/17
	Goal: Today, I will continue to try to make the JFileChooser display and make an image selectable so it shows in another window.
	I made the JFileChooser and image selected from it display. First, the file chooser popped up before the client connected to
	to the server. The image was able to be selected and displayed in another window by the client, but I wanted the server and
	client to connect before the file chooser popped up. After rearranging some commands, I was able to do it.
	My goal for the next day we work is to make an attachment button and implement what I worked on with the JFileChooser and image 
	sending over sockets to the main program.
Day 16: 5/26/17
	Goal: Today, I will make an attachment button and start the action listener.
	I made a button for uploading an attachment and started the action listener for the button. I tested out many different sizes
	and locations for the button. It was taking a little too long, so I proceeded to work on other things. I made a sendImage and 
	receiveImage method. I'll have to do the same thing for the server. I'll also have to adjust the size of the button. I could 
	make it so the button has a picture of a paperclip instead of it just saying "attachment". I also have to revisit the JTextPane 
	that I made for the image viewing.
	My goal for the next day we work is to continue working on the button and its functionality.
Day 17: 5/30/17
	Goal: Today, I will continue working on the attachment button and its functionality.
